            <p class="section3-paragraph">It has been a long time ago when the Market Square in Lviv (Rynok in Ukrainian) was a place of a commercial market. The buildings around the square once witnessed busy market days, public gatherings and celebrations. The oldest of the buildings date back to the 15th century, but most were rebuilt after the big fire of 1527 which destroyed most of the Gothic buildings of Lviv. The Town Hall in the center of the Market Square is more recent and was built in the 19th century. Its predecessor did not survive after the old town hall tower collapsed of its own weight in 1826. Some residents of Lviv disliked the new tower and the town hall and called them an “ugly chimney”, but the structure is now one of the landmarks of Lviv. </p>
